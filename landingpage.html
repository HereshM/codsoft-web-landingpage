        <p> IoT, or Internet of Things, is a network of physical objects that can connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet. These objects are also known as "smart objects" and can include household items, industrial tools, vehicles, and appliances. IoT devices are embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity, and can communicate with each other and with other internet-enabled devices

        <p> Artificial Intelligence Terms
            AI has become a catchall term for applications that perform complex tasks that once required human input, such as communicating with customers online or playing chess. The term is often used interchangeably with its subfields, which include machine learning (ML) and deep learning.
            
            There are differences, however. For example, machine learning is focused on building systems that learn or improve their performance based on the data they consume. Itâ€™s important to note that although all machine learning is AI, not all AI is machine learning.
            
            To get the full value from AI, many companies are making significant investments in data science teams. Data science combines statistics, computer science, and business knowledge to extract value from various data sources.
